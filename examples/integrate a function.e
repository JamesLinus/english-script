how to integrate a function from x to y:
default steps be 100
step size is the length of the interval, divided by the number of steps
let the initial value of I be x
end

while i is smaller or less then y do
 evaluate the function at point I
 add the result to the sum
 increase I by the step size
done

finally return the sum divided by the number of steps
// OK
# OK
/* OK */
