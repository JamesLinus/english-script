# The Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR) from Microsoft runs on top of the Common Language Runtime

# .net (ROSLYN) OPEN source OK
# MONO.CECIL syntax tree Better (why?)

#NRefactory is the C# analysis library used in the SharpDevelop and MonoDevelop IDEs. It allows applications to easily analyze both syntax and semantics of C# programs. It is quite similar to Microsoft's Roslyn project; except that it is not a full compiler â€“ NRefactory only analyzes C# code, it does not generate IL code.

# Going from C# or MSIL (CIL) to LLVM IR hasnt been done yet (or at least finished). You'd need a C# Front-End.
# VMkit had some kind of C# front end scaffolding. Support was never feature complete and interest has since faded. They've moved to just supporting Java.

# A full C# parser is available with our DMS Software Reengineering Toolkit (DMS for short). It has been used to process tens of thousands of C# files accurately. It provides automated AST building, tree traversals, surface-syntax pattern matching and transformation and lots more. As a commercial product it might not work out for a student project.

# ANTLR arguably offers a C# parser, but I don't know complete or robust it is, or whether it actually builds ASTs.
